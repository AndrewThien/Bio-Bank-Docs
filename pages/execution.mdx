# Execution Instruction

## Prerequisites

Before you can install and execute the `Bio Bank` project, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

### Clone the `bio-bank` repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewThien/Bio-Bank.git
```

### Navigate to the biobank directory:

```bash
cd bio-bank
```

### Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You also may need to create a `.env` file on the root folder, then add

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://nguyentrithien123:Hqz0da2XSGUY@ep-royal-voice-06161069.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/Bio-Bank?sslmode=require
```
This will ensure the Neon Database is loaded successfully.

### Execution:

 - Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

 - Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

You should now see the Bio Bank application running.

### Scripts:
The Bio Bank project includes the following npm scripts:

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Lints the code.

You can run these scripts with `npm run <script>`, where `<script>` is the name of the script.
