# Application Architecture

## Frontend

The application's frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses libraries such as react-query for data fetching and state management, lucide-react for icons, and react-hot-toast for displaying toast notifications. The frontend is also styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

## Backend

The backend is a serverless API built with Next.js, a React framework that includes server-side rendering and TypeScript support. The API in this project's stage includes endpoints for adding, viewing samples and collections of the bio bank.

## Database

The application uses Neon database to store data about samples and collections. [Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a serverless open-source alternative to AWS Aurora Postgres. It separates storage and compute and substitutes the PostgreSQL storage layer by redistributing data across a cluster of nodes.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel, which provides serverless deployment for Next.js applications.

## Version Control 

The project's codebase is managed by Git on the local machine and stored on GitHub for showcasing and collaboration.
