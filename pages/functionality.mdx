# Functionalities

As required by the assessment brief, the application at this stage facilitates the following functions and interfaces:

## Display the List of Collections

On the homepage, a list of collections is automatically loaded from the database and displayed when the user accesses the application.

While the data is being loaded, a loading indicator is shown to enhance the user experience.

## Display the Associated Sample Records

By clicking the collection title, users can access the records of the collection's associated samples.

More information about the collection and data about its samples are displayed. These sample records include Sample ID, Collection ID, Donor Count, Material Type, and the Last Updated Date. If there are no samples in the collection yet, the text "No Samples Record Found" is displayed.

While the data is being loaded, a loading indicator is shown to enhance the user experience.

## Adding a New Collection to the Bio Bank

Next to the table of collections on the homepage, users can easily find the place to add a new collection.

After filling in the required information about the collection, users can add it to the bio bank.

Upon clicking the button, a notification appears to confirm the action and its result, and the new collection is automatically displayed after a successful action.

## Adding a New Sample to the Selected Collection

Next to the table of samples on the collection's page, users can easily find the place to add a new sample.

After filling in the required information about the sample (in the correct data format, e.g., the donor count field will only accept numbers), users can add it to the current collection.

Upon clicking the button, a notification appears to confirm the action and its result, and the new sample is automatically displayed after a successful action.
