# [CollectionList Component](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Bio-Bank/blob/master/src/components/CollectionList.tsx)

The `CollectionList` component is a React component that fetches and displays a list of collections from a server. It's designed to be used in a Next.js application and uses the `react-query` and `axios` library for data fetching.

## Usage

```tsx
<CollectionList collection_id={1} onLoading={handleLoadingChange} />
```

## Props

The `CollectionList` component accepts the following props:

- `collection_id`: A number that represents the ID of the collection to fetch. If `collection_id` is `-1`, the component fetches all collections.

- `onLoading`: A function that's called with the loading state of the data fetch. It's called with `true` when the data is loading and `false` when the data has loaded.

## Data Fetching

The `CollectionList` component uses the `useQuery` hook from `react-query` to fetch data from the `/api/collections` endpoint. It sends a POST request with `collection_id` in the request body.

If the data fetch is successful, onLoading is called with `false`. If the data fetch fails, `onLoading` is called with `true` and an error toast is displayed.

#### POST `/api/collection` endpoint

```tsx

import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import { collections } from "@/lib/db/schema";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

export const runtime = "edge";

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {

  try {
    const {collection_id} = await req.json();
    // declare the returned collection
    let _collections;
    // Based on the passed value of collection id to select all or one collection
    if (collection_id === -1) {
      _collections = await db
      .select()
      .from(collections);
    } else {
      _collections = await db
      .select()
      .from(collections)
      .where(eq(collections.id, collection_id));
    }
    return NextResponse.json(_collections);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.log(error, "Fetching collections is going wrong")
    return NextResponse.json({error: "Fetching collections is going wrong"}, {status: 500}); 
  }
}

```
This API endpoint is designed to fetch and return a list of collections from a database. It's a POST endpoint that accepts a JSON body with a `collection_id` property.

The request to this endpoint should be a POST request with a JSON body. The JSON body should have a `collection_id` property, which is a number that represents the ID of the collection to fetch.

If `collection_id` is `-1`, the endpoint fetches all collections. Otherwise, it fetches the collection with the provided `collection_id`.

## Rendering

While the data is loading, the `CollectionList` component renders a `LoadingPage` component.

Once the data has loaded, the `CollectionList` component renders a table with the collection data. The table has columns for ID, collection title, associated disease, and creation date.

If `collection_id` is `-1`, the collection title in each row is a link to the manage page for that collection. Otherwise, the collection title is just text.

## Styles

The `CollectionList` component uses styles from `table.module.css` for the table. The other styles are utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Dependencies

The component depends on the following libraries:

- `react` for building the component
- `react-query` for fetching the samples
- `axios` for making the HTTP request to the `/api/samples` endpoint
- `@/app/table.module.css` for the table styles
- `@/components/ui/button` for rendering buttons
- `next/link` for rendering links
- `react-hot-toast` for displaying toasts
