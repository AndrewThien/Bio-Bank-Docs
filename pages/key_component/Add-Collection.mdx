# [AddCollection Component](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Bio-Bank/blob/master/src/components/AddCollection.tsx)

The `AddCollection` component is a React functional component used to add a new collection to the system.

## Usage

```tsx
<AddCollection />
```

## Functionality

The component maintains its own state for the `title` and `disease` fields of the new collection. These states are updated whenever the user types into the corresponding input fields.

When the form is submitted, the component sends a POST request to the `/api/add_collection` endpoint with the `title` and `disease` as the request body. The request is made using the `react-query` library's `useMutation` hook.

If the request is successful, the component invalidates the 'collections' query in the `react-query` cache to ensure that the newly added collection is included when the collections data is fetched next time. A success toast notification is also displayed.

If the request fails, an error toast notification is displayed.

After the form is submitted, whether the request is successful or not, the input fields are cleared

#### POST `/api/add_collection` endpoint

```tsx

import { db } from '@/lib/db';
import { collections } from '@/lib/db/schema';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const runtime = 'edge';

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
  try {
    const { title, disease } = await req.json();
    // Insert the values into the "collection" table
    await db.insert(collections).values({
      title: title,
      disease: disease,
    });

    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Collection data inserted successfully.' });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error inserting collection data:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Error inserting collection data.'},
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
};

```
The endpoint is implemented as a `POST` function in the `route.ts` file. The function uses the `db` object from the `@/lib/db` module to insert the collection data into the `collections` table in the Neon database. Entry's `id` and `created_at` values will be automatically handled by Neon database.

The function uses the NextResponse.json method from the next/server module to return the response. If the collection is added successfully, the response includes a success message. If there's an error, the response includes an error message and a status code of 500.

## Structure

The component returns a form with two input fields for the `title` and `disease` of the new collection, and a submit button. The form is laid out in a table for alignment.

## Styles

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The submit button uses the `Button` component from the `@/components/ui/button` module, and includes a plus circle icon from the `lucide-react` library.

## Dependencies

The component depends on the following libraries:

- `react` for building the component
- `react-query` for making the POST request and managing the cache
- `react-hot-toast` for displaying toast notifications
- `lucide-react` for the plus circle icon
- `@/components/ui/button` for the submit button styling
