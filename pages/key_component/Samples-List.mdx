# [SampleList Component](https://github.com/AndrewThien/Bio-Bank/blob/master/src/components/SamplesList.tsx)

The `SamplesList` component is a React functional component used to display a list of samples from a specific selected collection in the system.

## Usage

```tsx
<SamplesList collection_id={1} />
```

## Props

`collection_id` (number): The ID of the selected collection from which the samples will be fetched.

## Functionality

The component uses the react-query library's useQuery hook to fetch the samples from the /api/samples endpoint. This component also used `axios`, a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from a web browser, to make the process of fetching data easier. The collection_id prop is sent as the request body.

The fetched samples are displayed in a table. Each row in the table corresponds to a sample and displays the sample's id, collection_id, donor_count, material_type, and last_updated fields.

If no samples are fetched, a message saying "No Samples Record Found" is displayed.

#### POST `/api/sample` endpoint

```tsx

import { db } from "@/lib/db";
import { samples } from "@/lib/db/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export const runtime = "edge";

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
  try {
    const { collection_id }  = await req.json();
    const _samples = await db
      .select()
      .from(samples)
      .where(eq(samples.collection_id, collection_id));

    return NextResponse.json(_samples);
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(error, "Fetching samples is going wrong");
    NextResponse.json(
      {error: "internal server error"},
      {status: 500});
  }
};

```
The endpoint is implemented as a `POST` function in the `route.ts` file. The function uses the `db` object from the `@/lib/db` module, and `eq` (equal) operator from the `drizzle-orm` module (which is in charge of managing the database) to fetch the sample data from the `samples` table in the database, based on the matching the `collection_id` value of samples and the passed `collection_id` in the request.

The function uses the NextResponse.json method from the next/server module to return the response. If the sample is added successfully, the response includes a success message. If there's an error, the response includes an error message and a status code of 500.

## Structure

The component returns a `div` element that contains either a table of samples or a message saying "No Samples Record Found", depending on whether any samples are fetched.

The table has a row for each sample, and each row has a cell for each field of the sample.

## Styles

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The table uses the `table` class from the  `@/app/table.module.css` module.

## Dependencies

The component depends on the following libraries:

- `react` for building the component
- `react-query` for fetching the samples
- `axios` for making the HTTP request to the `/api/samples` endpoint
- `@/app/table.module.css` for the table styles
