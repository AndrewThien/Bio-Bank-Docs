# Bio Bank Documentation

This documentation covers the web application I developed for managing tissue sample collections as part of the developer assessment for a software engineering role at the University of Nottingham.

The goal of this application in this stage is to provide an administrative interface that allows users to track tissue samples associated with different disease collections. Key features include:

- Displaying a list of tissue sample collections, with information on the collection's disease term and title
- Drilling into a specific collection to view details on the samples currently associated with that collection
- Adding new tissue samples to existing collections
- Creating new collections to store groups of tissue samples

The application was built using Next.js, a mordern React framework for building full-stack web applications, and covers the core requirements outlined in the assessment brief. It is designed with a focus on maintainability, extensibility, and ease of understanding the codebase.

This documentation will provide:

- An overview of the application architecture and main functionalities
- Key components' description
- Installation and execution instructions
- "Future" thinking about the project

The goal is to provide insight into the design and implementation decisions to aid future maintenance and expansion of the application. Additional "Future" section covers potential enhancements, and general recommendations.
